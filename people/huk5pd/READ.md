- Hometown: Sudbury, MA
- Hobbies: Lacrosse, Fantasy Football, Reading and going to gym
- First Computer I Ever Saw: White Mac Desktop Computer
- About me: I’m from Sudbury, Massachusetts, a town about 30 minutes outside of Boston.
  I spent most of my high school years at Phillips Academy Andover, where I also played lacrosse, a sport I’ve loved since childhood.
  Even now, I enjoy watching and playing lacrosse when I can find the time. I have two younger brothers: one is a
  first-year student at Duke, and the other is a sophomore in high school.
  When I’m home, I love spending time with my Great Dane, Ivy, and visiting Cape Cod.
