- Hometown: Orlando, FL
- Hobbies: cycling, guitar, cooking
- First Computer I Ever Saw: My father was a pharmacist and his drugstore bought a huge (and very expensive) DEC VAX computer in the early 1980s. It was the size of a refrigerator, the storage disks were about 12" wide, and every night it would connect to a drug manufacturer's mainframe to order refills for drugs that were sold that day.
- About me: I joined the SDS faculty in the summer of 2023, and enjoy building and destroying worlds in the cloud. I live on a small farm west of Charlottesville, where we raise chickens, goats, and sometimes bees.
